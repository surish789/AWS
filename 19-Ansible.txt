Tools: Ansible, cheff, puppet

Ansible:
-develop by redhat
-Open source
-configuration mgmt tool(we can trigger and deploy number of tasks at a time)
-Componants: Play books(yaml scripts-(.yml)), config mgmt file, Deployment
(yaml- yet another markup lanuguage)
-Using playbooks we can deploy, manage, build, test, Configuration mgmt
-Ansible written in python(By default)
-push based machanism
-It will install ACM only, no need to install nodes thats why we called agent less Architechture
-main configuration file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Componants:
1)ACM(Ansible control manager/master)
- Only one
- Install Ansible 
2)Nodes/targeet machines
- N number of nodes
- No need to install ansible

-> we will write playbooks in ansible control master but this action reflect on nodes.
-> thats why its also called push based method/Agent less architecture.
-> communication between master And node is SSH, Protocol is TCP/IP Protocol
-> All instances (Master and nodes) should be same availability zone

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cheff and pupper:
-> it is a client server architecture
-> 1 Server(Node),No of clients(Master) 
-> Agent architecture. so, we need to install ansible in both servers -server and client
-> Cook books (DSL -Groovy scripts)
-> Pull based machanism
-> we don't get a python script by default
-> there are no modules configuration tasks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Ansible through we can launch ec2 instance for that we need to install pip
-Take one Instance -name: Ansible-master
-take Ubuntu machine- keypaiar-pem
-Connect server
-sudo -i

(Search-install ansible in ubuntu 20.04 step by step- Digital ocian)
->sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
->sudo apt update
->sudo apt install ansible
-ansible --version

(we need ti install pip coz we have boto file boto file have all aws services)
(how to install pip on ubuntu 2024)

->sudo apt install python3-pip
->pip3 --version
->pip install boto3
-> find / -name boto
-> cd /usr/local/lib/python2.8/dist-packages/boto
->ls
->cd [enter]
->vi ~/.boto
-[Credentials]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
->git clone https://github.com/techtutorials/ansible-palybooks.git
->ls
->cd ansible-playbook/
->ls
->cd Ec2
->ls
->cat spinawsec2.yml
->vi spinawsec2.yml
[give our key pair name]
-count:1
-ecc:wq!
(now we run ansible playbook)
->ansible-playbook spinawsec2.yml
check: go to console -two instances created
->vi terminate.yml
[instance id's=give our instance ID]
-> ansible-playbook terminate.yml
(it will deleted Instaces)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
->vi apache.yml
"----
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: install apache2
      apt: name=apache2 update_cache=yes state=latest"

->ansible-playbook apache.yml
->systemctl start apche2
->systemctl status apache2
