Virtual Private Cloud(VPC)

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a virtual network in the cloud that lets you launch AWS resources, 
like servers and databases,in a controlled and isolated environment. 
It's like having your own slice of the internet within AWS, 
where you can define your IP address range, create subnets, and set up security measures to protect your resources.

   give name and CIDR. Ex: 192.168.1.0/24 (which means we have 255 Network IP's) -> Create
   Go to Actions-> Edit subnet settings-> Enable Auto assign IP.

5) Create Internet gateway
   Create->Enter a name for the gateway ->Create
   Go to Actions ->Attach Internet gateway to VPC.

6) Configure Route Tables
